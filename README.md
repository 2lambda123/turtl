# Turtl server

This is the new Turtl server. It handles a number of things for Turtl clients:

- Account management (join/login/delete)
- Data storage
- Syncing
- Permissions and sharing

It implements a plugin architecture so things like analytics and payment
processing can be used without forcing a particular method/service.
